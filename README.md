# Ghozt
Development for Ghozt, the Discord Bot.
This is the Python based implementation of the bot. 

Welcome to Ghozt! 
Ghozt is a Discord Bot that I'm just working on for fun every once in a while. It's a neat little project and can be greatly improved and developed on for general server management and other things. 

Current functions:
^^signal <@mentions> <reason> --- takes a bat signal image, and helps @ your friends to assemble them, for games. or hanging out. 

^^roll <num_dice>d<num_sides> --- a dice roller with NdN format

^^count <name> [new_counter] --- create a new counter or add 1 to an existing counter

^^timey <hour> <minute> --- creates a time and date to display in user local time with today's year/month/day and user input hour (0-23) and minute (0-59)

^^long_timey <month> <day> <hour> <minute> --- creates a time and date to display in user local time with today's year and user input month (0-12), day (0-31), hour (0-23), minute (0-59)
  
^^help / ^^help <function_name> --- provides help and usage context for the functions
