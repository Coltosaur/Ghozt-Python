# Ghozt
Development for Ghozt, the Discord Bot by Coltergeizt.
This is the Python based implementation of the bot. 

Welcome to Ghozt! 
Ghozt is a Discord Bot that will be used to share and build a database of quotes from friends in your own Guild. 
It'll also be used to help translate between English and Spanish more easily inside the Discord app itself. 
And, in the future, will be used for general Guild management purposes. 

Currently, Ghozt is a completely private bot, in very early stages of development.
If access is desired, the owner will help out.
